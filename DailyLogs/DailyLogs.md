------------------------------------
|1|8-Sep-2020| Set up Dev and GIT environment.Started on the exercises and samples in the Data Analyst Workshop.|
|2|9-Sep-2020| Still in the first chapter. Could not get much done today. WIll start tomorrow. Goal is by the end of next week finishchapter 1 exercises and repeat the same in R. So a total of 11 days.|
|3|10-Sep-2020| I could not get anything done had more work than I bargained for|
|3|11-Sep-2020| Next step in Data Analysis. Calculating Rolling Means and Standard Deviations and visualizing them via Seaborn, learnt about FacetGrid and how to plot distribution of Bike Sharing Data by hour by day of the week , by day by season. Added T-Testing to test difference in sample means between seasons, test differences between weekday and weekend.Completed all the wrangling in python. Next step is to replicate this in R and then get back to python for Time Series Analysis.|
|4|12-Sep-2020| Completed | Set the project up in R. Revised basics of tidyverse and ggplot. Set up the data and the initial distribution analysis.
|5|13-Sep-2020| Completed | Spent a good amount of time to learn about newer plot types in R like geom_ribbon and converting from wide to longer etc.Completed setting up till the analysis of time series and rolling means. The transformations and graphics took more time than python.|
|5|14-Sep-2020| Could not get to work as I had more work commitments| 
|5|15-Sep-2020| Could not get to work as I had more work commitments| 
|6|16-Sep-2020| FInished the EDA of the dataset. Learn Building bar plot , column plot and the facet grid. Learnt new features like tidy,nest and unnest in the tidyverse. Started with basic t-tests. Goingforward I think i will do the exercies in R and Python simultaneously.
